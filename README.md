## Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

### Project Description
In this project, I built an ETL pipeline using Python. I was tasked with defining a fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and wrote an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Project Dataset
This project required building a data model for 2 dataset.

### 1. Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

A single song file can look like this
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

```

### 2. Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

## Schema Design
### Fact Table
- A single fact table named songplays
- 4 Dimension tables: users, songs, artists, time.

## Project Structure
The project contain six files

- test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to let you check the database and see that everything is in lace.
- create_tables.py drops and creates the tables. You run this file to reset the tables before each time you run the ETL scripts.
- etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into the tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
- etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
- sql_queries.py contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
- README.md provides discussion on your project.

## Run the Project
To run this project 
- First you will need to download or clone the project repo.

To Create tables
- Run the create_tables.py. This will create your tables and databases
- Test with test.ipynb to ensure that all the database and the table have been created.

To Build the ETL process
- Run create_tables.py to reset the tables.
- Run the etl.ipynb to develop the etl process for each table.
- Run test.ipynb notebook to check if it works

To Build the ETL Pipeline
- Run creatt_tables.py to reset the tables in the database
- Run etl.py to process the whole files.
- Run the test.ipynb notebook to check that your tables have been processed.
